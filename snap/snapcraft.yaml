summary: Python tool for collecting, parsing, and storing data from HAProxy instances.
description: |
  The HAProxy Collector is a Python package designed to collect, parse, 
  and store configuration and runtime data from HAProxy instances. 
  It integrates with database systems and supports advanced HAProxy 
  features such as backend switching and ACLs. The collector maps domains to 
  backend server IPs, stores data in a database, and is modular and extensible for 
  advanced use cases.
